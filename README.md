# TerraPath Hub

TerraPath Hub is the public guide catalog and editor for TerraPath.

This repository contains the published guide catalog, the web editor, the guide
schema, curated Terraria support data, and the GitHub issue flows used to submit
new guides and report project feedback.

`Build guide -> Submit -> Review -> Publish -> Browse`

## What This Repo Contains

- A GitHub Pages site with the guide catalog and editor.
- Public guide JSON files in `guides/`.
- Generated catalog data in `catalog/`.
- The guide schema in `schema/`.
- Curated support data and extracted web icons in `supported/`.
- Submission and publication automation in `.github/` and `tools/`.
- Deterministic multi-mod registry in `supported/mods.registry.json`.

Guides are stored as structured JSON on purpose, not as free-form wiki pages.
That keeps them searchable, valid, sortable, and ready for future in-game use.

## How To Use This Repo

### For guide authors

1. Open the published editor.
2. Build your guide and check the preview.
3. Export `guide.json`.
4. Open one `Guide submission` issue per guide.
5. Paste the exported JSON and submit it.
6. Update the same issue if changes are requested before publication.

### For visitors

- Open the published site to browse guides.
- Use the guide browser filters to narrow by class, language, or required mods.
- Open any guide page to read the structured stages and item sections.
- Use the raw JSON link if you want to inspect the stored guide data directly.

## Where To Write

- Use `Bug report` issues for broken pages, wrong data, submission problems, or site regressions.
- Use `UI feedback` issues for usability feedback, layout ideas, or workflow improvements.
- Use `Supported mod request` issues when you want TerraPath Hub to index a new mod for the web editor.
- Use `Guide submission` issues only for one exported `guide.json` file.

## Current Status

- The public editor, guide browser, and issue-based submission flow are live.
- The web editor ships with curated Terraria data and can also load generated Calamity support packs.
- Support packs are deterministic: the editor reads canonical generated metadata instead of runtime category inference.
- Calamity Mod support is rebuilt from local export + supplement rules in this repo.
- Additional mods are tracked in wave-based onboarding via `supported/mods.registry.json`.
- Published guides are reviewed before they are added to the public catalog.
- The TerraPath tModLoader mod source lives separately from this public hub.

## Important Notes

- This repository is public by design. The site code, schemas, support data,
  and automation live here openly.
- This is not a private backend or a hidden source drop.
- TerraPath Hub is for structured guides, not for general-purpose wiki pages.
- The web editor only knows curated supported content. The in-game mod can
  eventually resolve more from installed mods than the website can show today.
