# TerraPath Moderation Flow

This repository uses a lightweight issue-based moderation flow for community guides.

## Labels

- `guide-submission`: the issue contains a guide proposal.
- `needs-review`: waiting for a maintainer review.
- `validated`: the JSON passed automatic validation.
- `validation-failed`: the JSON is invalid and needs changes.
- `approved`: a maintainer approved the guide for publication.
- `automated-pr`: a pull request was created automatically from an approved issue.
- `published`: the approved issue was closed after publication.

## Author flow

1. Open the guide editor on GitHub Pages.
2. Build the guide and review the preview.
3. Open the guide submission issue form.
4. Paste the exported `guide.json`.
5. Submit the issue.
6. Wait for the automatic validation comment.
7. If validation fails, edit the issue body and fix the JSON.

## Moderator flow

1. Open issues with `guide-submission` and `needs-review`.
2. Check that the issue has the `validated` label.
3. Read the guide for progression quality, naming, clarity, and supported content.
4. Ask for edits in the issue if the guide is not ready.
5. Add the `approved` label when the guide is ready to publish.
6. Review the automatically created pull request.
7. Merge the pull request into `main`.

## What automation does

### On issue submission or edit

The `Review guide submissions` workflow:

- extracts `guide.json` from the issue body;
- validates it with `tools/issue_submission.py` and `tools/validate_guides.py`;
- adds either `validated` or `validation-failed`;
- updates a bot comment with the current moderation status.

### On approval

The `Publish approved guide` workflow:

- extracts the guide from the approved issue;
- writes it into `guides/<locale>/<guide-id>/guide.json`;
- rebuilds the catalog;
- creates a pull request back to `main`.

The generated pull request body includes `Closes #<issue-number>`, so merging it closes the original submission issue automatically.

### After merge

The `Mark published guides` workflow:

- watches for approved submission issues being closed;
- adds `published`;
- removes `needs-review` and `approved`.

## Local dry-run testing

You can test the moderation flow locally before relying on GitHub Actions.

### Validate an issue body

Save a copied issue body into a text file and run:

```bash
python tools/issue_submission.py validate-issue --issue-body-file issue-body.txt
```

### Export a guide from an issue body

```bash
python tools/issue_submission.py export-issue --issue-body-file issue-body.txt
python tools/validate_guides.py
python tools/build_catalog.py
```

### Test the full publication path safely

1. Create a test guide issue.
2. Copy its body into a local text file.
3. Run the validation and export commands above.
4. Check the generated file in `guides/`.
5. Open the guide locally through `browse.html` and `guide.html`.
6. Revert the test changes or use a throwaway branch.

## Recommended repository settings

- Keep `main` protected.
- Require pull requests for changes to `main`.
- Let only maintainers apply the `approved` label.
- Treat `approved` as the final moderation decision before publication.
